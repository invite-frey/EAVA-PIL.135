# Airport: EGLL

## A1:
- RWY 09R/27L ENTRY/EXIT AT S4W RESTRICTED TO DAYLIGHT OPR ONLY - ID:A1679/24【4:0†source】
- RWY 09R/27L ENTRY/EXIT AT S4E. TWY CENTRELINE LIGHTS U/S - ID:A1610/24【4:1†source】
- RWY 09R/27L EXIT/ENTRY AT N4W CLOSED DUE WIP - ID:A1347/24【4:2†source】
- BLUE EDGE LIGHTS INSTALLED AT RWY 09R/27L EXIT/ENTRY AT S6 - ID:A1352/24【4:2†source】
- TWY LIMA CLOSED AT LIMA 2 DUE WIP - ID:A1598/24【4:6†source】

These NOTAMs are relevant under the CRITICAL categories because they pertain to limitations or closures of runways and taxiways, which impact AIRPORT OPERATIONS (specifically concerning runway closures or limitations) - fitting the CRITICAL category of "3. Runway closed ANY PERIOD of time OR runway not available for either approaches, take-off or landing."

## A2:
No applicable NOTAMs

## A3:
Based on my analysis of the NOTAMs at EGLL (London Heathrow Airport) that affect runway usability, here are the relevant NOTAMs prioritized according to the specified criteria:

1. **RWY 09R/27L entry/exit at N4W closed due to work in progress (WIP)** - ID: [A1347/24]【4:6†source】. This closure affects operations on one of Heathrow's main runways by limiting access at a specific point, directly impacting runway usability.

2. **RWY 09R/27L entry/exit at S4W restricted to daylight operations only** - ID: [A1679/24]【4:0†source】. This limitation only allows use of this runway entry/exit point during daylight, potentially impacting operations scheduled for night-time.

All other NOTAMs related to ground light installations or closures of taxiways do not have a direct impact on the availability of runways for takeoff, landing, or approaches and are therefore not included. The reviewed NOTAMs present limitations rather than full closures, thus, they fall under the less critical categories for runway usability considerations.

## A4:
- Lit crane operating close to Heathrow, max height 85FT AGL/166FT AMSL, no operations during safeguarding or low visibility procedures - ID:[A1600/24]【4:5†source】.
- New crane added to London Heathrow obstacles, positioned at 513008N 0002437W, elevation/height 343FT AMSL/236FT AGL, with steady red lighting - ID:[A1852/24]【4:4†source】.
- Another new crane erected at Terminal 2A, Heathrow Airport, position 512811N 0002704W, elevation/height 213FT AMSL/131FT AGL, with steady red lighting - ID:[A1853/24]【4:4†source】.
- Temporary restricted area active due to Ascot Racecourse activities within 2NM radius of 512515N 0003934W, affecting all aircraft including drones and small balloons, surface up to 2000FT AMSL - ID:[J0616/24]【4:8†source】.
- UAS only temporary restricted area active for Wembley within 1.5NM centered at 513321N 0001646W - ID:[J0614/24]【4:9†source】.

# Airport: EDDF

## A1:
For the airport EDDF, the following NOTAMs are identified as critical:

- **Runway 07L/25R closed** - ID:[A1492/24]【4:6†source】
- **Runway 07R/25L closed** - ID:[A1493/24]【4:6†source】
- **Runway 18 closed** - ID:[A1494/24]【4:2†source】

## A2:
Here is a summary of the NOTAMs relating to Instrument Landing Systems (ILS), other NAVAIDs (VOR, DME, or NDB), and GPS RAIM anomalies reported for the airport EDDF:

### Critical:
- **ILS (Z) RWY 07L downgraded to CAT III with minimum DH 50FT and RVR 200M** - ID: [A0250/24]【4:4†source】.
- **ILS GP RWY 25R Y's coverage limitations: Usable up to 15NM between specific degrees of RCL with minimum interception altitudes specified** - ID: [A0222/24] .
- **ILS RWY 25R(Z), DME IFNW localizer coverage limitations up to 17NM in specific sectors related to RCL, with minimum interception altitudes detailed** - ID: [A1169/24] .
- **DVORTAC FFM 114.20/CH89X DVOR part not usable in sectors 170DEG to 180DEG clockwise with distance and altitude limitations** - ID: [A3170/22] .
- **Changes to ILS/DME Z 25R and ILS/DME Y 25R due to redundancy with IFNW/IFWR DME, including specific DME adjustments** - ID: [A0711/24] .

### Not Critical:
No identified NOTAMs directly related to GPS RAIM anomalies for this context.

Priorities are determined based on the operational impact these NOTAMs could have on approaches and landings at EDDF, especially under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) pertinent to commercial operations with widebody jet aircraft of wake category C.

## A3:
- **RWY 18 CLOSED** during 2200-0400 from March 18, 2024, to March 23, 2024 - ID:[A1494/24]【4:2†source】.
- **RWY 07R/25L CLOSED** during 2200-0400 from March 18, 2024, to March 23, 2024 - ID:[A1493/24, A1493/24]【4:2†source】 .
- **RWY 07L/25R CLOSED** during 2200-0345 from March 18, 2024, to March 23, 2024 - ID:[A1492/24] .

## A4:
- Increased migratory bird activity over and in the vicinity of the aerodrome - ID:A0313/24 
- Excessive bird activity observed around the airfield - ID:D0128/20【4:4†source】
