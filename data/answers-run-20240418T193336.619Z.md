- **ILS MPV RWY 31R Unserviceable** - ID:[A1124/24] .

These NOTAMs are critical for flight operations and should be prioritized accordingly.

## A2:
After reviewing the NOTAMs for LFML, there are two relevant issues affecting the Instrument Landing Systems (ILS), other NAVAIDs (VOR, DME, or NDB), and GPS RAIM anomalies:

1. **ILS MPV RWY 31R Unserviceable** - The ILS for Runway 31R is reported as unserviceable, and it is advised not to use due to possible false indications. This is critical information for approaches under Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) - ID:A1124/24 .
2. **LDG DME 31R Modifications** - The DME for 31R has been modified, including changes in altitude at foot, DME coverage limited to 25 degrees on the left of the localizer axis at 17NM/2500FT, and DME not received on the left of the localizer axis at 25NM/4500FT - ID:A1148/24 .

These NOTAMs are of high priority for flight planning and operations, directly impacting the approach phase under IFR conditions for wake category C aircraft operating at LFML.

## A3:
- **RWY 13R/31L closed** from March 18 at 0630 to March 21 at 1600 - ID:[A1117/24]【4:1†source】.
- **Visual approaches for runways 31R and 31L prohibited by night** due to HBN unserviceable; effective from January 19 at 1259 to April 5 at 0443 - ID:[A0275/24]【4:1†source】.
- **Mandatory use of PAPI for RWY 31R and RWY 31L**; effective from January 19 at 1258 to April 5 at 0443 - ID:[A0274/24]【4:4†source】.
- **RWY 31L RNP H approach procedure prohibited**; effective from January 19 at 1252 to April 5 at 0443 - ID:[A0272/24]【4:8†source】.

The priority of these NOTAMs follows from critical (runway closure) to restrictions affecting the usability of runways during visual approaches at night, mandatory use of PAPI instruments, and prohibited approach procedures, which are all essential to the safety and navigation of the aircraft during landing and takeoff.

## A4:

# Airport: LFMN

## A1:
- **Instrument Landing System (ILS) for RWY 04L out of service** - ID:[A1210/24]【4:3†source】.

## A2:
Among the NOTAMs for airport LFMN, I found the following ones directly affecting the Instrument Landing Systems (ILS), other NAVAIDs (VOR, DME, or NDB), and GPS RAIM:

- **ILS RWY 04L Unserviceable** - ID:[A1210/24] .

There are NOTAMs regarding obstacles erected near the airport, but none specifically mention impacts to NAVAIDs or GPS RAIM anomalies directly. Hence, the critical information for flight planning regarding instrument approaches and navigational aids at LFMN is the unserviceability of the ILS for runway 04L during the specified times.

## A3:
Here are the NOTAMs related to runway closures or conditions affecting runway usability at LFMN:

- **RWY 04L/22R CLOSED** - ID:[A1211/24]【4:5†source】.
- **ILS RWY 04L U/S (Unserviceable)** - ID:[A1210/24]【4:5†source】. This NOTAM is relevant as it affects instrument landing system availability, although not directly a runway closure, it impacts operations especially under IFR.
- **RWY 04R: EF RAPID EXIT SIGNBOARD IS MISSING** - ID:[A6378/23]【4:3†source】. This affects situational awareness during high-speed exits from the runway.
- **ILS RWY 04R U/S (Unserviceable) DUE TO MAINTENANCE** - ID:[A1153/24, A1153/24]【4:4†source】【4:7†source】. Scheduled maintenance may affect instrument landing capabilities during the specified period.

Priority should be given to the runway closure (RWY 04L/22R CLOSED) as this is a critical issue directly affecting airport operations. The unavailability of ILS for RWY 04L and RWY 04R should be considered next due to its impact on IFR operations, especially under poor weather conditions. Lastly, the missing exit signboard on RWY 04R is also important for maintaining operational safety during landings and takeoffs.
