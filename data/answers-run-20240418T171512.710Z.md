# Airport: EGLL

## A1:
After reviewing the NOTAMs for London Heathrow Airport (EGLL), the following NOTAMs fall under the CRITICAL categories and are relevant:

- **RWY 27L/09R rehabilitation (resurfacing)**: This represents a limitation related to runway availability, which is critical for airport operations. - ID: [A1726/24]【4:0†source】.

No other NOTAMs related to EGLL are classified as critical based on the provided priority list.

## A2:
After reviewing the NOTAMs for EGLL, there were no reported issues directly or indirectly affecting the Instrument Landing Systems (ILS), other NAVAIDs (VOR, DME, or NDB), and GPS RAIM anomalies.

No applicable NOTAMs

## A3:
The following NOTAMs are relevant to the current availability of runways at EGLL (London Heathrow Airport) due to closures or conditions affecting runway usability:

- **RWY 27L/09R is undergoing rehabilitation (resurfacing), which may affect runway availability** - ID:[A1726/24]【4:0†source】.
- **Runway 09R/27L entry/exit at S4W is restricted to daylight operations only** - ID:[A1679/24]【4:0†source】.
- **RWY 09R/27L exit/entry at N4W closed due to work in progress (WIP)** - ID:[A1347/24]【4:4†source】.

These NOTAMs should be prioritized as follows:

1. NOTAM ID A1726/24 due to rehabilitation works, which might imply significant restrictions on runway availability【4:0†source】.
2. NOTAM ID A1347/24 indicating a specific exit/entry closure due to work in progress, directly impacting ground movements related to this runway【4:4†source】.
3. NOTAM ID A1679/24, which limits the use of an entry/exit point on runway 09R/27L to daylight operations only, affecting operations planning【4:0†source】.

Other notices related to taxiways and lighting do not directly affect runway availability and have thus been excluded from this summary.

## A2:
For the task focused on identifying all reported issues affecting Instrument Landing Systems (ILS), other NAVAIDs (VOR, DME, or NDB), and GPS RAIM anomalies at EDDF airport, here is a summary of the relevant NOTAMs:

- **ILS GP RWY 25R Y limitation to coverage changes, usable up to 15NM between specified degrees of RCL, minimum interception altitude 2800FT** - ID:[A0222/24]【4:6†source】.
- **ILS (Z) RWY 07L downgraded to CAT III, minimum DH 50FT and RVR 200M** - ID:[A0250/24]【4:4†source】.
- **ILS/DME changes for ILS/DME Z and Y 25R due to redundancy with IFNW/IFWR DME, including addendums to DME distances reflecting new measurements** - ID:[A0711/24]【4:7†source】.
- **Frankfurt DVORTAC FFM DVOR part not usable in specified sector 170DEG TO 180DEG clockwise under certain altitude and distance conditions** - ID:[A3170/22]【4:1†source】.

These NOTAMs cover crucial information about ILS and DVOR limitations, detailing the impact on navigation aids essential for approaches and departures, directly relevant to the task of reporting issues affecting ILS, other NAVAIDs, and GPS RAIM anomalies at EDDF.
