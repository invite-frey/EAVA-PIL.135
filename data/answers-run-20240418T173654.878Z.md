# Airport: EGLL

## A1:
Based on the priority list provided, here are the CRITICAL NOTAMs for EGLL:

- **RWY 27L/09R rehabilitation (resurfacing).** - ID:[A1726/24]【4:0†source】
- **RUNWAY 09R/27L ENTRY/EXIT AT S4W restricted to daylight operations only.** - ID:[A1679/24]【4:0†source】
- **TWY LIMA closed at LIMA 2 due to WIP.** - ID:[A1598/24]【4:6†source】

These NOTAMs are considered critical because they directly affect airport and runway operations.

## A2:
No applicable NOTAMs

## A3:
- **Runway 27L/09R entry/exit at S4W is restricted to daylight operations only** - ID:[A1679/24]【4:0†source】.
- **Runway 27L/09R rehabilitation work requires caution**, triggered by AIP SUP 028/24 effective from 03 Apr until 31 Oct. Although exact closure times are not specified, expect rehabilitation work during this period - ID:[A1726/24]【4:1†source】.
- **Exit/entry at N4W for Runway 09R/27L is closed due to Work in Progress (WIP)**, effective until 17 Apr 2024 - ID:[A1347/24]【4:2†source】.


## A4:
Based on the task provided, here are the relevant NOTAMs for airport EGLL that report safety hazards within the airport perimeter or its immediate airspace:

- **Temporary restricted area active for Ascot Racecourse within 2NM radius. Applies to all aircraft including drones and parascending parachutes** - ID: [J0616/24]【4:2†source】.
- **Temporary restricted area active for UAS (Unmanned Aircraft Systems) only at Wembley within 1.5NM radius** - ID: [J0614/24]【4:3†source】, [6:6†source】.

These NOTAMs are prioritized as significant due to the potential hazards that such activities (Ascot Racecourse events and UAS operations at Wembley) can cause within the airport's immediate airspace.

# Airport: EDDF

## A1:
Critical NOTAMs for EDDF are as follows:

- RWY 07R/25L CLSD - ID: A1493/24【4:3†source】.
- RWY 07L/25R CLSD - ID: A1492/24【4:6†source】.
- RWY 18 CLSD - ID: A1494/24【4:3†source】.
- ILS RWY 25R(Z), DME IFNW: LOC COVERAGE and MIN INTERCEPTION ALT limitations - ID: A1169/24【4:5†source】.
- ILS (Z) RWY 07L DOWNGRADED TO CAT III - ID: A0250/24【4:7†source】.

These NOTAMs cover closures of runways and issues with Instrument Landing Systems (ILS), which are essential for landing, especially under poor weather conditions or during night operations.

## A2:
Below are the NOTAMs for EDDF directly or indirectly affecting Instrument Landing Systems (ILS), other NAVAIDs (VOR, DME, or NDB), and GPS RAIM anomalies, prioritized according to the provided guidance:

### CRITICAL
- **ILS (Z) RWY 07L downgraded to CAT III**; impact includes minimum DH 50FT and RVR 200M - ID:[A0250/24] .
- **ILS GP RWY 25R Y limited coverage changed**; usable up to 15NM between specific degrees of RCL, with minimum interception altitude adjustments - ID:[A0222/24] .
- **DVORTAC FFM DVOR part not usable** in specified sectors and below certain altitudes AMSL. This limitation is permanent - ID:[A3170/22] .
- **Redundancy changes involving IFNW/IFWR DME**; includes adjustments to DME distances for ILS/DME Z and Y 25R - ID:[A0711/24] .
- **ILS RWY 25R(Z), DME IFNW** specific coverage details for LOC, including maximum NM in sectors and minimum interception altitudes - ID:[A1169/24] .

### NOT CRITICAL
No additional NOTAMs related to GPS RAIM anomalies were identified within the given criteria for the EDDF NOTAMs summary. 

These NOTAMs provide significant details regarding the limitations and adjustments to ILS and other NAVAIDs at EDDF. Pilots and relevant personnel should consider these when planning and conducting operations at or in the vicinity of the airport.

## A3:
The analysis of NOTAMs at Frankfurt Airport (EDDF) related to runway closures, or conditions affecting runway usability, can be summarized as follows:

- **Runway 07R/25L closed** from March 18, 2024, 22:00 UTC to March 23, 2024, 04:00 UTC - ID:[A1493/24]【4:0†source】.
- **Runway 07L/25R closed** from March 18, 2024, 22:00 UTC to March 23, 2024, 03:45 UTC - ID:[A1492/24]【4:2†source】.
- **Runway 18 closed** from March 18, 2024, 22:00 UTC to March 23, 2024, 04:00 UTC - ID:[A1494/24]【4:4†source】.

## A4:
For the task of reporting safety hazards within the airport perimeter or its immediate airspace at EDDF, including bird activity, drones, or other unusual hazards and omitting NOTAMs relating to obstacles not specifying effects on runway usability, as well as taxiway closures or lighting anomalies, the relevant NOTAMs are:

- Increased migratory bird activity over and in vicinity of aerodrome - ID:[A0313/24]【4:3†source】
- Excessive bird activity observed around the airfield - ID:[D0128/20]【4:3†source】

There are no NOTAMs reported for EDDF related to drone activity or other specified unusual hazards fitting the criteria provided.
