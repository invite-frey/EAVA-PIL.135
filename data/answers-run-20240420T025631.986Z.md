- **RWY 18 CLOSED** during night hours from March 18, 2024, 2200 UTC to March 23, 2024, 0400 UTC - ID:[A1494/24]【4:2†source】.

- **ILS (Z) RWY 07L DOWNGRADED** to CAT III ICAO classification, in service until April 16, 2024 - ID:[A0250/24]【4:4†source】.

These NOTAMs fall within the CRITICAL categories as defined:

1. **Runway Closure** (Categories 3) - All three runways have scheduled closures, significantly impacting airport operations during the specified times.
  
5. **Instrument Landing System (ILS) Unsuitable** (Category 5) - With the ILS for RWY 07L downgraded, this affects IFR approaches for a specific runway, although not fully unserviceable, it is a downgrade thus affecting precision approaches for that runway.

## A2:
For airport EDDF, the following NOTAMs are relevant to Instrument Landing Systems (ILS), other NAVAIDs (VOR, DME, or NDB), and GPS RAIM anomalies, categorized as per the task requirement:

- **ILS unserviceable (Critical Category 5):**
    - [ILS (Z) RWY 07L downgraded to CAT III, minimum DH 50FT and RVR 200M] - ID:A0250/24【4:4†source】.
    - [ILS GP RWY 25R Y limited coverage change: Usable up to 15NM between 004DEG(L)/003DEG(R) of RCL, minimum interception altitude 2800FT] - ID:A0222/24 .

- **Other NAVAID (VOR, DME, or NDB) unserviceable (Not Critical Category 6):**
    - [Frankfurt DVORTAC FFM 114.20/CH89X DVOR part not usable in sector 170DEG to 180DEG clockwise, with detailed altitude and distance limitations] - ID:A3170/22 .
    - [ILS RWY 25R(Z), DME IFNW changes due to redundancy with IFNW/IFWR DME including adjustments in distances] - ID:A0711/24 .
    - [ILS RWY 25R(Z), LOC coverage up to 17NM in specified sectors, with minimum interception altitude at 3000FT MSL or 2880FT MSL at less than 16.1NM from antenna] - ID:A1169/24 .

- **GPS RAIM outage or downgrade (Not Critical Category 7):**
    - No applicable NOTAMs.

In summary, there are significant NOTAMs regarding ILS downgrades and coverage limitations, as well as specifics about DVOR usability, which are essential for navigation and approach planning at EDDF. Prioritization should be given to the ILS unserviceability and NAVAID limitations, as they directly impact approach procedures and aircraft navigational capabilities.

## A3:

# Airport: EHAM

## A1:
Based on the provided priority list for categorizing NOTAMs as critical, and after reviewing the NOTAMs for EHAM airport from the provided file, the following NOTAMs fall within the critical categories:

- ILS RWY 36R downgraded to I/C/4 (supports CAT I operations) - ID:[A0711/24]【4:1†source】.
- ILS RWY 36C downgraded to III/E/3 (supports CAT III operations) - ID:[A0005/24] .

No other NOTAMs related to EHAM airport fall within the critical categories as defined.

## A2:
After reviewing the NOTAMs related to EHAM, the following directly or indirectly affect the Instrument Landing Systems (ILS), other NAVAIDs (VOR, DME, or NDB), and GPS RAIM anomalies:

- **ILS RWY 36R downgraded to support Category I operations only** - ID:[A0711/24]【4:1†source】.

No NOTAMs related to other NAVAIDs or GPS RAIM anomalies at EHAM were found in the provided documents.

## A3:
The following NOTAMs are relevant to the current availability of runways at EHAM and affect runway usability due to closures or conditions (like maintenance, snow, ice, or debris):

- **RWY 06-24 Closure** due to unspecified reason, affecting operations from February 22, 2024, until May 25, 2024. - ID:[W0080/24]【4:5†source】.
- **Construction Equipment on STRIP RWY 06/24**, between 635M and 1360M beyond THR RWY 06 and 130M left of RCL, 22FT AMSL, from December 19, 2023, until March 31, 2024. - ID:[A2627/23]【4:3†source】.
- **Crane Erection near RWY 06/24**, at PSN 521812.9N 0044529.2E, 2064M beyond THR 06 and 610M left of RCL, 184FT AMSL, marked and lighted, operational during hours 2200-0400 from March 25, 2024, to March 28, 2024. - ID:[A0714/24]【4:4†source】.

Given the criticality priorities:
1. Runway closure due to NOTAM ID: [W0080/24] is categorized under priority 3 as it results in the closure of RWY 06-24, directly impacting airport runway operations.
2. The presence of construction equipment (NOTAM ID: [A2627/23]) and crane erection (NOTAM ID: [A0714/24]) near or on a runway suggests significant potential for impact on runway usability, also falling under priority 3 due to potential constraints on aircraft operations on RWY 06/24. 

In summary, the runway 06/24 at EHAM is closed until May 25, 2024, and there is construction equipment and a temporary crane operating near this runway, which may impact operations on adjacent runways or taxiways. The primary concern is the complete closure of runway 06/24 as detailed in NOTAM ID: W0080/24.

- **ILS MPV RWY 31R unserviceable - DO NOT USE - possible false indications** - ID:[A1124/24]【4:6†source】

These NOTAMs are critical as they impact airport operations significantly: one relates to runway closure and the other to the unavailability of a crucial instrument landing system.

## A2:
Given the task to identify all reported issues affecting Instrument Landing Systems (ILS), other NAVAIDs (VOR, DME, or NDB), and GPS RAIM anomalies at the LFML airport, the relevant NOTAMs are prioritized as follows:

**CRITICAL:**

1. **ILS unserviceable** - 
    - **[NOTAM Summary]**: ILS MPV RWY 31R U/S - DO NOT USE - possible false indications. 
    - **ID**: [A1124/24] .

2. **DME associated with ILS changed** - 
    - **[NOTAM Summary]**: LDG DME 31R MPV modified - Altitude at foot: 94FT, DME coverage limited to 25DEG on the left of localizer axis at 17NM/2500FT, DME not received on the left of the localizer axis at 25NM/4500FT. 
    - **ID**: [A1148/24] .

**NOT CRITICAL:**

There were no NOTAMs related to **other NAVAIDs (VOR, DME, or NDB) unserviceable** or **GPS RAIM outage or downgrade** specifically mentioned for LFML in the provided list. 

Other reported obstacles and conditions did not directly pertain to ILS, other NAVAIDs, or GPS RAIM anomalies and thus were not included in the critical or not critical lists as per the task specifics.
