# Airport: EGLL

## A1:
Based on the critical categories provided for prioritization, here are the applicable NOTAMs for EGLL (London Heathrow Airport):

1. **Runway Rehabilitation** - ID:[A1726/24]
   - The rehabilitation (resurfacing) of Runway 27L/09R affects airport operations directly by impacting the available runways for use.

2. **Runway Entry/Exit Restrictions** - ID:[A1679/24]
   - Restrictions on Runway 09R/27L entry/exit at S4W to daylight operations only due to limited visibility or access, potentially reducing operational capacity or requiring alternative planning for nighttime operations.

3. **Taxiway Centreline Lights Unserviceability** - ID:[A1610/24]
   - While not directly impacting runway or airport closure, unserviceable taxiway centreline lights for Runway 09R/27L entry/exit at S4E can pose significant safety concerns, especially during low visibility or night operations, thus impacting overall airport safety and operations.

All other NOTAMs identified within the search, such as modifications to taxiway edge lighting, temporary restrictions, and work in progress not directly affecting runway operations, are categorized as non-critical according to the provided priority list and are thus omitted from this summary【4:0†source】.

## A2:
No applicable NOTAMs

## A3:
Based on the available NOTAMs for London Heathrow (EGLL), the following NOTAMs are relevant concerning runway closures or conditions affecting runway usability:

- **RUNWAY 09R/27L ENTRY/EXIT AT S4W RESTRICTED TO DAYLIGHT OPR ONLY** due to work in progress - ID: [A1679/24]【4:0†source】.

- **RUNWAY 09R/27L EXIT/ENTRY AT N4W CLOSED** due to work in progress - ID: [A1347/24]【4:1†source】.

- **RUNWAY 09R/27L REHABILITATION (RESURFACING)** indicated by TRIGGER NOTAM for AIP SUP 028/24 effective from 03 APR 24 until 31 OCT - ID: [A1726/24]【4:2†source】. 

These NOTAMs are prioritized due to their direct impact on runway availability and operational limitations.

## A4:
- Temporary restricted area active for Ascot Racecourse within 2NM radius of specified coordinates due to UAS activity. This also applies to all aircraft including small balloons, kites, and parachutes, except for those with stated exceptions. - ID: J0616/24【4:2†source】
- Temporary restricted area active for UAS only within 1.5NM centred on specified coordinates near Wembley. Exceptions are stated in the AIC. - ID: J0614/24【4:3†source】

## A2:
For the airport EDDF, here are the reported issues directly or indirectly affecting the Instrument Landing Systems (ILS), Other NAVAIDs (VOR, DME, or NDB), and GPS RAIM anomalies:

### CRITICAL

- **ILS (Z) RWY 07L downgraded to CAT III** with minimum DH 50FT and RVR 200M. This affects ILS serviceability and represents a downgrade in capability - ID: [A0250/24]【4:4†source】.

- **ILS GP RWY 25R Y limited coverage** change: Usable up to 15NM between 004DEG(L)/003DEG(R) of RCL. Minimum interception altitude 2800FT - ID: [A0222/24] .

- **Changes due to redundancy with IFNW/IFWR DME:** ILS/DME Z 25R and ILS/DME Y 25R adjustments to DME readings - ID: [A0711/24] .

- **DVORTAC FFM 114.20/CH89X DVOR part not usable** in specific sectors and below determined altitudes. This pertains to the VOR portion of the NAVAID being partially unusable, directly impacting navigational aids - ID: [A3170/22] .

- **ILS RWY 25R(Z), DME IFNW:** Localizer coverage up to 17NM in specified sectors related to RCL and minimum interception altitudes defined. This notice directly affects the ILS serviceability by providing specific operational limits - ID: [A1169/24] .

### NOT CRITICAL

No notifications regarding GPS RAIM anomalies were found in the provided NOTAMs for EDDF.

### SUMMARY

The prioritized list focuses on the direct impacts on ILS and DVOR/DME NAVAIDS functions at EDDF. Despite the range of operational limitations and adjustments specified, no NOTAMs regarding GPS RAIM anomalies were discovered. This analysis provides clarity on the current operational status of critical navigational aids at EDDF.
