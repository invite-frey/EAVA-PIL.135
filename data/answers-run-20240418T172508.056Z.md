# Airport: EGLL

## A1:
Based on the provided priority list for categorizing NOTAMs as critical, the review for London Heathrow Airport (EGLL) yielded the following results:

- No applicable NOTAMs

All identified NOTAMs related to EGLL in the provided data either pertain to work in progress, taxiway or runway entry/exit limitations during daylight operations, installation of lighting, and obstructions. These categories fall outside the specified critical categories, including airport or runway closures, significant operational impacts due to accidents or weather events, ILS outages, and significant delay advisories.

## A2:
No applicable NOTAMs

## A3:
Following NOTAMs are relevant to runway closures or conditions affecting runway usability at EGLL (London Heathrow Airport):

- **RWY 27L/09R rehabilitation (resurfacing)** - ID:[A1726/24]【4:0†source】
- **RWY 09R/27L entry/exit at S4W restricted to daylight operations only** - ID:[A1679/24]【4:0†source】

# Airport: EDDF

## A1:
Critical NOTAMs for EDDF are as follows, prioritized from most critical to least critical:

1. **Runway 18 closed from March 18, 10:00 PM to March 23, 4:00 AM** - ID:[A1494/24]【4:2†source】.
2. **Runway 07R/25L closed from March 18, 10:00 PM to March 23, 4:00 AM** - ID:[A1493/24]【4:6†source】.
3. **Runway 07L/25R closed from March 18, 10:00 PM to March 23, 3:45 AM** - ID:[A1492/24]【4:6†source】.
4. **ILS (Z) RWY 07L downgraded to CAT III, minimum decision height (DH) 50FT and minimum runway visual range (RVR) 200M until April 16, 11:59 PM** - ID:[A0250/24]【4:4†source】.

These NOTAMs cover runway closures and instrumentation downgrades, both of which are critical for flight planning and safety.

## A2:
- ILS (Z) RWY 07L downgraded to CAT III with minimum DH 50FT and RVR 200M - ID:[A0250/24]【4:0†source】.
- ILS Glide Path (GP) RWY 25R coverage limited, usable up to 15NM between 004 degrees left and 003 degrees right of RCL, minimum interception altitude 2800FT - ID:[A0222/24]【4:4†source】.
- Frankfurt DVORTAC FFM 114.20/CH89X DVOR part not usable in sector from 170 degrees to 180 degrees clockwise at various altitude and distance limitations - ID:[A3170/22, A3170/22]【4:2†source】【4:7†source】.
- No reported GPS RAIM anomalies or outages for EDDF in the provided documents. 

These NOTAMs could potentially affect flight operations due to alterations in ILS capability and DVOR usability at Frankfurt Airport (EDDF).

## A3:
Based on the NOTAMs review for EDDF, here are the relevant NOTAMs related to runway closures or conditions affecting runway usability:

- **RWY 18 closed** from March 18, 2024, 2200 UTC to March 23, 2024, 0400 UTC. - ID:[A1494/24]【4:1†source】
- **RWY 07R/25L closed** from March 18, 2024, 2200 UTC to March 23, 2024, 0400 UTC. - ID:[A1493/24]【4:2†source】
- **RWY 07L/25R closed** from March 18, 2024, 2200 UTC to March 23, 2024, 0345 UTC. - ID:[A1492/24]【4:5†source】
- **Work in progress (WIP) on RWY 18**, minimal distance of 75M WEST from the runway centerline (RCL) during daily 0500-1700 UTC from February 5, 2024, to March 30, 2024. - ID:[A0658/24]【4:7†source】
- **Obstacle Crane affecting RWY 07C and RWY 07R operations**. Due to the crane's position, OCA(H) for several runway approaches has been raised, effective from December 19, 2023, to March 19, 2024. - ID:[A6933/23]【4:8†source】

Priority should be given to runway closures as they directly impact airport operational capability, followed by work in progress and obstacles affecting approaches due to their impact on safety and operations.
